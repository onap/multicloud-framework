      "message": "Hi Bin Sun, thanks for the updated design spec. Appreciate your effort. \nI do believe we need such event federation , and I can understand how the publisher works, but I cannot figure out how the listener is working. With the impression I had from previous discussion, the listener is to listen oslo event from openstack. My concern is that: Is that reasonable or even possible for multicloud (which is part ONAP hence outside of OpenStack) to listen oslo events which are supposed to be protected by security rules of VIM, or even unreachable due to network connectivity? \nPlease correct me if I got your point wrong. Thanks",
