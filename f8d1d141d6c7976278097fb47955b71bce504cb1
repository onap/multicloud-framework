      "message": "Based on the addition of the vfmodule-model-ids, I think the generic intent is for multicloud to look up and gather the artifacts for an instantiation based on those IDs.  Therefore, the artifact arguments present in this \u0027template_data\u0027 section are redundant.  Instead of this change, I would say to just remove \u0027files\u0027, \u0027template\u0027, and \u0027environment\u0027 all together.",
