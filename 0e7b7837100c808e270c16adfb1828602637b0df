Regarding \"act according to it\", which actions do you have in mind after the code reads YAML?\n\n2. Can you expand the full definition of YAML file as you mentioned above? I admit that myself, as a normal person, won\u0027t be able to write an YAML yet after reading this document in its current format.\n\n3.
