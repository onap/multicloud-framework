I prefer sticking to existing overall architecture with regarding to how broker and plugins collaborate and the flexibility to deploy/maintain as well as to expose NBIs via MSB.\n\nThis Multi process framework could be applied to individual plugins which is up to their committer/maintainer\u0027s choice.
